# Course-Scheduler

## Abstract
Effective course scheduling is essential for the smooth functioning of
educational institutions, particularly those employing a Fully Flexible Credit
System (FFCS) like Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Chennai. This
system allows students to select their courses and professors, which, while
beneficial, poses significant scheduling challenges due to potential clashes in
time slots. This project presents a backtracking algorithm-based approach to
optimize course scheduling within the FFCS framework. By considering
constraints such as theory and lab slot clashes, professor availability, and
course requirements, our method systematically generates conflict-free
schedules. The proposed solution not only aids in reducing scheduling conflicts
but also serves as a tool for VIT management to detect course clashes and
allocate seats efficiently, thereby enhancing the overall academic experience
for students and faculty.
